This is a fork of `coreui-nostr-free-react-admin-template`. That template retains all of the pages from `coreui-free-react-admin-template`, which demo all that the template is capable of. In this repo, extraneous pages that are unrelated to nostr will be deleted, and the basic nostr functions will be expanded upon and polished a bit, with several pages added, including:
- view active relays
- view my follows
- view profile of other users
- store my kind 1 notes in redux and display them (event.id only, nothing fancy)
