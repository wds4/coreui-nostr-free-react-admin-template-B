This is a fork of `coreui-nostr-free-react-admin-template`. That template retains all of the pages from `coreui-free-react-admin-template`, which demo all that the template is capable of. In this repo, extraneous pages that are unrelated to nostr will be deleted, and the basic nostr functions will be expanded upon and polished a bit, with several pages added, including:
- view active relays
- view my follows
- view profile of other users
- store my kind 1 notes in redux and display them (event.id only, nothing fancy)

A record of steps will be kept in this README as I go along.

# Steps

- In github, go to repo for `coreui-nostr-free-react-admin-template`, find `Use this Template` - select `Create a new repository`, and name it `coreui-nostr-free-react-admin-template-b`.
- Cloned locally: 

```
git clone https://github.com/wds4/coreui-nostr-free-react-admin-template-b.git
cd coreui-nostr-free-react-admin-template-b
npm install
npm start
```
- Go to Vercel account, find `Add New Project`. Should see option to `Import Git Repository`. Select the repo we just created. Use these options:
- Framework Preset is Vite. (automatically)
- Did NOT select src as the root directory, just left it as it is.
- Under Build and Output Settings, next to Output Directory, click Override and replace `dist` with `build`.
- Under Install Command, click Override and enter npm install (not sure if this is necessary)
- No Environmental Variables.
- Click Deploy.
